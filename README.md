# Egg-Drop-Problem
You are given N identical eggs and you have access to a K- floored building from 1 to K. There exists a floor f where such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
o An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
o A broken egg must be discarded.
o The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
o If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not
break at any floor below.
o If the eggs breaks at a certain floor, it will break at any
floor above.
Our task is to print the minimum number of moves or steps that you
need to determine what the value of threshold floor is.
